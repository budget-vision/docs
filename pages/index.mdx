# **What is Budget Vision?**

Budget Vision helps you to plan your budget and lets you see transactions in a calendar with daily balance per account/currency or total in one currency.

Focuses on future planning, highlighting possible cash shortages instead of past and tracking expenses.

<Callout>
  The main strength of Budget Vision is that it allows to plan with **high level
  of uncertainty**.

...And get prepared in advance.

</Callout>

## Features

- **Focus on future**: View expected balance for each day in the future, see when you can afford to buy something or when you need to save more.
- **Multi-currency**: See balance in each currency, or total sum in one currency of your choice.
- **Expenses tracking**: See all your expenses in a calendar, filter by account, category, or tag.
- **AI Powered**: Just write "_Coffee 3.5 past monday_", "_groceries 20eur_", or "_rent 1k on 5th_" and it will create a transaction for you.
- **But it's not an expense tracker**: It's not meant to track every single expense, but rather to help you plan your budget and see how much you can spend.
