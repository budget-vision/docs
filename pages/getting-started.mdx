## What is a Budget Vision?

_A calendar you've always had in your head._ The personal budgeting app, aimed to help you find answers:

- 💰 how much am I going to have next Monday?
- 🌍 I have X bucks, Y euros, Z Thai bath, and a bit of coins, how much is it in total??
- 🤔 when is it a good time to buy \<tickets\/gadget\/etc\>? Can I do it now or better wait for a week?

⏳and more.

<Callout>
  Unlike **expense tracking** apps, this one is aimed mostly at **future**,
  giving you an option to juggle your planned expenses to **find the best time**
  to use your money.
</Callout>

## How to get started

<Callout type="info" >
<p className="text-xl font-bold">TL;DR:</p>
1. Update the balance (use the Right-click -> "Create correction" button on any day)
2. Add regular transactions (salary, rent, bills, groceries, etc.)
3. Add future one-time transactions (vacation, doctor, etc.)
4. Log your past transactions

Check in and repeat in a week (or bi-weekly, or monthly, whatever you want)

  </Callout>

<Steps>
#### Log in and set accounts
Adjust currencies, add more accounts for savings or other if needed.

### Set actual balance for all accounts

<img src="/img/reconcile.png" className="img" />
Start here, set actual balance for all accounts, so you can see how much you can
spend. You'll be prompted to update the balance on login, and you can do it manually
as well.

### Add transactions

{" "}

<img src="/img/add-transactions.png" alt="Add transaction" className="img" />

Go for regular expenses and incomes first, like payroll, rent, bills, groceries, etc. Add them as
recurring transactions, so you don't have to add them every time.

#### Use Telegram Bot for easy AI-powered transactions

Go to [Settings -> Telegram Bot](https://www.budget.vision/settings/ai-input), set it up, and just write the transaction in Telegram.

Examples:

- "100$ bill last Thu"
- "80 groceries" _(will be recorded as 80 eur (if default account is in EUR) today)_
- "5+2 coffee yesterday" _(will be recorded as 7 eur for coffee yesterday)_

### Plan ahead

Add any known future transactions, maybe you know you need to pay for something in a few months,
or you want to save for something, or any one-time expenses, like vacation, doctor, etc.

Add them as future transactions, so you can see how much you can spend now.

</Steps>

# Step by step guide

_TL;DR: Start from generic things, smoothly moving to more specific ones:_

## Setup

- Start with regular monthly income & expenses (salary 🤑, rent 🏠, credits 🏦, bills 🧾, etc.)

  <img
    src="/img/gs1.jpeg"
    alt="Start with regular monthly income & expenses (salary 🤑, rent 🏠, credits 🏦, bills 🧾, etc.)"
    className="img"
  />

- Now, (bi-)weekly (groceries 🛒, weekend shopping 🛍️ , etc.)

  <img
    src="/img/gs2.jpeg"
    alt="Now, (bi-)weekly (groceries 🛒, weekend shopping 🛍️ , etc.)"
    className="img"
  />

- Finally, some generic & random things you don't remember but know exist. 🍷 (+ you can add rough estimates for subscriptions, gym, parties, birthdays, ATM, etc.)

  Now your initial monthly dashboard may look like this. Feel free to move things around to make it yours

## Actual planning

### Example 1 (easy)

As you can notice, each day with any transaction now shows your balance for that day. **This is the key feature of the Money Calendar.**

_This allows you to spot breaking moments until they actually happen. Let's take a look:_

<aside>
⚠️ Here we can see that after the rent payment, I’ll have $200 - it's less than 10% of my monthly income, and there is a risky period until my next salary.

</aside>

<img
  src="/img/gs4.jpeg"
  alt="Here we can see that after the rent payment, I’ll have $200 - it's less than 10% of my monthly income, and there is a risky period until my next salary."
  className="img"
/>

Ok, this is quite an easy one, right? Lets move on:

### Example 2 (still easy)

Time to plan for the future - how much can I save each month? Let's take a look:

{/* ![Untitled](/img/gs5.jpeg) */}

<img
  src="/img/gs5.jpeg"
  alt="I want to save 10% from the salary - 300$/m. How can I set this up?"
  className="img"
/>

> I want to save 10% from the salary - 300$/m. How can I set this up?

As we see here - there are two things I can do:

- Save $300 from salary on 19th
- Save $150 both on 4th and 19th.

But are those options equal? Of course, not - if I save twice a month: on 4th and 19th - something interesting is going to happen:

<img
  src="/img/gs6.jpeg"
  alt="I’ll have 50$ for the next 3-4 days."
  className="img"
/>

I’ll have 50$ for the next 3-4 days.

> Murphy's First Law: **Anything that can go wrong will go wrong**.

<aside>
⚠️ I’ve left with no right for mistake. If I spend 50$ more within the first 19 days of the month - I’ll go broke.

</aside>

So I’ll pick the other option: save 300$ on the 19th.

### Example 3 (plan things)

<aside>
⚠️ Now, we can see at first glance the next thing: **how much we can really spend** today, this week, on shopping, etc.

</aside>

<img
  src="/img/gs7.jpeg"
  alt="200$ is lowest until 19th, and 950$ - until 3rd."
  className="img"
/>

200$ is lowest until 19th, and 950$ - until 3rd.

So when a friend calls me and offers to go out on Friday, the 12th - I can assume that it would fit my budget much better next Friday - the 19th.

Also, I see that I can actually go with him and estimate my budget for this, so I don't have to borrow money. **Nice.**

### Example 4 (overspending)

Ok, I’ll go to the bar on the 12th.

Oh, God, I totally forgot about that yearly subscription to my Apple account. 🤦‍♂️

<img
  src="/img/gs8.jpeg"
  alt="Ok, it's still possible to go out with the friend next week. Glad that I can see this beforehand."
  className="img"
/>

Ok, it's still possible to go out with the friend next week. Glad that I can see this beforehand.

## How to follow the budget with corrections

Each time you login, you'll be prompted to update the balance for today. You can also do it manually anyyime.

The more often you update the balance, the more accurately you'll be able to see coming shortcomings in your budget (hopefully none).

<Callout>
  After the balance is set, new transactions added before the correction **will
  update the correction amount automatically**.
</Callout>

## Frequent questions

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="item-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>Is it free?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      While it's not free, we do offer a free trial. You can try it out for 7
      days, no credit card required. You can even export your data if you decide
      to, or request to have your data deleted.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="item-2">
    <AccordionTrigger>Is there mobile app?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      At this time, there is no mobile app. However, the web app is mobile
        friendly and works well on mobile devices.

        There are two main reasons for not having a mobile app:

        Since the app is focused not on expense tracking with quick and easy access, but for planning and saving the budget, it competes better with Excel or tools like that.

I don't know how to fit core information (daily balances) on a small screen well enough. I don't
want to have to hide information behind many tabs or buttons. I want to see
everything at a glance.

    </AccordionContent>

</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="item-3">
    <AccordionTrigger>Can I export all my data?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
        Yes, you can export all your data at any time. You can also request to
        have your data deleted.

  <AccordionItem value="item-4">
    <AccordionTrigger>Sync transactions with bank?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
        Nope, this is not a feature at this time. I'm considering adding it in the future, when the user base grows enough to cover integration costs.

        But you can import transactions from your bank. You can import QFX, QBO, OFX, and CSV files. You can also import transactions from other apps, such as Mint, YNAB, and others.

        This is a manual process at this moment, but it'll be automated in the future.

        To request import, just send me an
        <a href="mailto:dmitrii@malakhov?subject=Budget%20Vision%20Data Import" className="underline text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email</a>
        with the file attached, and I'll import it for you.
