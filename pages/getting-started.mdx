# How to get started

<Steps>

Start here, set actual balance for all accounts, so you can see how much you can
spend.

### Add transactions

Go for regular expenses and incomes first, like payroll, rent, bills, groceries, etc. Add them as
recurring transactions, so you don't have to add them every time.

### Plan ahead

Add any known future transactions, maybe you know you need to pay for something in a few months,
or you want to save for something, or any one-time expenses, like vacation, doctor, etc.

Add them as future transactions, so you can see how much you can spend now.

# Step by step guide

_TL;DR: Start from generic things, smoothly moving to more specific ones:_

## Setup

- Start with regular monthly income & expenses (salary 🤑, rent 🏠, credits 🏦, bills 🧾, etc.)

    alt="Start with regular monthly income & expenses (salary 🤑, rent 🏠, credits 🏦, bills 🧾, etc.)"

- Now, (bi-)weekly (groceries 🛒, weekend shopping 🛍️ , etc.)

- Finally, some generic & random things you don't remember but know exist. 🍷 (+ you can add rough estimates for subscriptions, gym, parties, birthdays, ATM, etc.)

## Actual planning

### Example 1 (easy)

As you can notice, each day with any transaction now shows your balance for that day. **This is the key feature of the Money Calendar.**

_This allows you to spot breaking moments until they actually happen. Let's take a look:_

<aside>
⚠️ Here we can see that after the rent payment, I’ll have $200 - it's less than 10% of my monthly income, and there is a risky period until my next salary.

</aside>

<img
  src="/img/gs4.jpeg"
  alt="Here we can see that after the rent payment, I’ll have $200 - it's less than 10% of my monthly income, and there is a risky period until my next salary."
  className="img"
/>

Ok, this is quite an easy one, right? Lets move on:

### Example 2 (still easy)

Time to plan for the future - how much can I save each month? Let's take a look:

{/* ![Untitled](/img/gs5.jpeg) */}

<img
  src="/img/gs5.jpeg"
  alt="I want to save 10% from the salary - 300$/m. How can I set this up?"
  className="img"
/>

> I want to save 10% from the salary - 300$/m. How can I set this up?

As we see here - there are two things I can do:

- Save $300 from salary on 19th
- Save $150 both on 4th and 19th.

But are those options equal? Of course, not - if I save twice a month: on 4th and 19th - something interesting is going to happen:

<img
  src="/img/gs6.jpeg"
  alt="I’ll have 50$ for the next 3-4 days."
  className="img"
/>

I’ll have 50$ for the next 3-4 days.

> Murphy's First Law: **Anything that can go wrong will go wrong**.

<aside>
⚠️ I’ve left with no right for mistake. If I spend 50$ more within the first 19 days of the month - I’ll go broke.

</aside>

So I’ll pick the other option: save 300$ on the 19th.

### Example 3 (plan things)

<aside>
⚠️ Now, we can see at first glance the next thing: **how much we can really spend** today, this week, on shopping, etc.

</aside>

<img
  src="/img/gs7.jpeg"
  alt="200$ is lowest until 19th, and 950$ - until 3rd."
  className="img"
/>

200$ is lowest until 19th, and 950$ - until 3rd.

So when a friend calls me and offers to go out on Friday, the 12th - I can assume that it would fit my budget much better next Friday - the 19th.

Also, I see that I can actually go with him and estimate my budget for this, so I don't have to borrow money. **Nice.**

### Example 4 (overspending)

Ok, I’ll go to the bar on the 12th.

Oh, God, I totally forgot about that yearly subscription to my Apple account. 🤦‍♂️

<img
  src="/img/gs8.jpeg"
  alt="Ok, it's still possible to go out with the friend next week. Glad that I can see this beforehand."
  className="img"
/>

Ok, it's still possible to go out with the friend next week. Glad that I can see this beforehand.
