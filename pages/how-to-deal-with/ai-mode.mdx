# How to use "AI Mode" to create transactions

## What is "AI Mode"?

When you create a transaction, you can choose to use "AI Mode" to create a transaction. "AI Mode" will automatically fill in the transaction information for you.
You only need to enter the transaction description like '_groceries 20_', '_rent 5th 1k_', or '_aws 20eur yesterday_'. The transaction information will be automatically filled in by the system.

    Adjust keywords in categories settings to make AI mode more accurate.

    _For example, you can create "Subscriptions" category, and add keywords like "netflix", "spotify", "aws" to it. Then when you create a transaction like "_aws 20eur yesterday_", the system will automatically fill in the category as "Subscriptions"._

## In App

To use "AI Mode" to create transactions, you don't need any extra steps. Just type in the transaction description, and you're good to go.
You can opt out of using "AI Mode" by default in quick settings.

You can always switch between "AI Mode" and "Manual Mode" when creating transactions.

## In Telegram Bot

To start using "AI Mode" in Telegram Bot, you need first to connect your Telegram account to your account in the app.
To do that, go to the **Settings -> AI Input | Telegram bot** and click the "Start bot" button.

Telegram bot does not support "Manual Mode" yet, nor does it support other actions like viewing, editing or deleting existing transactions.
