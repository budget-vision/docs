# How to track savings with Budget Vision?

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
  TL;DR: Create a new account for each savings goal. Toggle the "Hide in the
  dashboard" switch to exclude the account from your regular budget.
</Callout>

## Step by step guide

<Steps>
### Create a new (hidden) account
Give it a name that describes your savings goal. For example "New car" or "Emergency fund".

_Optionally, toggle "Hide from dashboard" switch. This will exclude the account from your regular budget. You can turn it back on at any time to see your progress._

### (Optional) Toggle the "Show hidden accounts in the dashboard" switch

Go to quick settings on top right corner and toggle the "Show hidden accounts in the dashboard" switch. This will show all hidden accounts in the dashboard.

<div className="flex items-start space-x-4">
  <img src="/img/open-settings.png" alt="Open settings" className="img" />
  <img
    src="/img/toggle-hidden.png"
    alt="Toggle hidden accounts"
    className="img"
  />
</div>

### Add a transaction

Add a transaction to the account to track your progress. For example, if you want to put 100 EUR into emergency fund, add a transaction with this amount.

<div className="flex items-start space-x-4">
  <img src="/img/add-to-emergency.png" alt="Add transaction" className="img" />
  <img
    src="/img/add-to-emergency-result.png"
    alt="Add transaction"
    className="img"
  />
</div>

### Track your progress

Then you can track your progress in the dashboard. In accounts list you will see the total amount of money in each of your savings accounts.

You can switch "Show hidden accounts in the dashboard" switch back to hide the accounts from the dashboard.
