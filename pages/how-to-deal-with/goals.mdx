# Goals and wishlists

Budget Vision allows you to plan budget when you don't have enough money to buy something right now.
This may be some of your regular expenses, or something you want to buy in the future.

For this purpose there is an "Inbox".

  **Inbox** is a place where you can put your goals and wishes. You can put
  there anything you want to buy in the future.
